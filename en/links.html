                        <p>
                            In spite of the great difficulties, especially for having 
                            to open his own office at a time of crisis, he 
                            never gave up and says he never regretted it. 
                            regretted it.
                            <br>
                            And since stopping is not in his dictionary, he intends to 
                            to specialize in certain areas of law.
