                        and to protect tenants in a particularly fragile situation, among others, by amending the 
                        situation, amending, among others, the Civil Code ("Código Civil")

                        The provision for four rent arrears of more than 
                        than eight days in a year, entitles the landlord to eviction

                        <br>
                        To be applied in certain situations, the law provides for a

                        To apply in certain situations, the law provides for a transitional regime, which can last for five years, with gentler increases, in order to avoid an abrupt increase 
                        of rents for people in a weaker economic situation, as will be the case 
                        weak economic situation, as will be the case, for instance, of people with a monthly income of up to

                        <br>
                        As in the previous regimes, given the innovations introduced 
                        and the protection mechanisms for needier households, it is foreseen that the 
                        needy households, it is foreseen that the updating of the rents outlined 
                        by this legal regime may cover a large number of thousands

                        Before the date foreseen for its entry into force, the Government will 
                        approve the necessary diplomas for its execution - the regime

                    Legal advice consists of technical clarification on 
                    applicable law to practical questions posed by our 
                    constituents, using a language understandable to the citizen.

                <p>
                    It is important to remember that the legal advisor may not be the same 
                    lawyer who will represent the individual or organisation in 
                    possible proceedings. 
                    Their role is to provide information and advice on the legal 
                    legal matters that these individuals or companies need to resolve on a day-to-day basis.
                </p>

                    With regard to service, it can be carried out in many 
                    different ways: they can be face-to-face consultations, by telephone 
                    or even online (via skype or similar).
                </p>
                <p>
                    It may include the performance of extrajudicial steps that 
                    directly resulting from the legal advice, and are 
                    essential to the resolution of the issue raised.

                    We conclude a contract in advance, which can be a one-off 
                    consultation for a specific case, or a monthly retainer contract, 
                    in cases where the consultancy is something more recurrent for the 
                    client.
